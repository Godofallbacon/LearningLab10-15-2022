"Plural Sight Notes"
   /*
    - tests are to test if a small unit of code in the class, method or function works correctly
    - If a unit test excercises target code in several classes at once it is referred to as component tests
    - the test code obtains of the results of the target code and tests to make sure those results are correct
    - If you use an assertEquals to compare collections JUnit will check that the two collections contain equivalent objects using the equals method on each object and that they are in the same order
    - assertEquals checks that 2 objects are equal
    - assertTrue checks if a condition is true
    - assertFalse checks if a condition is false
    - assertNotNull checks that an object is not null
    - assertNull checks that an object is null
    - assertSame method tests if 2 object references point to the same object
    - assertNotSame method tests if 2 object references do not point to the same object
    - assertArrayEquals method will tests whether 2 arrays are equal to each other
    - @Disabled disables a test method but still shows it
    - @Tag a value to a method will indicate that you want to run tests with that expression in them
    - If we want to test code with mixed concerns we need to extract
    - You may not be able to get a hold of the output you would like to apply assertions to. They are sent directly to reports or user interfaces with no chance for a test to intercept them. These are referred to as inaccessible inputs
    - Drive the developement from a test before you implement a feature
    - Code Cohesion = code should only do one thing and it should do it well
